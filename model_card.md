## Model Details
    - Person or organization developing model: Abimael DomÃ­nguez
    - Model date: 2023-04-17
    - Model version: 0.1.0
    - Model type: Binary classificator (Gaussian Naive Bayes)
    - Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied approaches, and features

## Intended Use
    - Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
    - Use cases: the model can help to segment people for purpouses such as marketing or public policies to create strategies to address social or economic, issues affecting a community or society.

## Training Data
    - Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.
    - Original file: data/census.csv

## Evaluation Data
    - Datasets:
        - test_size = 20%
        - CV: 5
    - Preprocessing:
        - The program takes in the data, processes it, trains the model, and saves it and the encoder.
        - Most of the preprocessing is performed by the data.py script.

## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._
    - Model performance measures

        - compute_roc_curve(X_test, y_test, best_model)
            - Creates a picture of the ROC curve. This function was tested with a Naive Bayes model from Scikit Learn.
        - compute_model_metrics(y, preds)
            - Validates the trained machine learning model using precision, recall, and F1.
        - compute_metrics_on_slices(data, slice_column, label_column, prediction_column)
            - This function computes performance metrics on subsets of input data for a model's predictions, 
            and returns a list of dictionaries containing the computed metrics for each slice. 
    - Best hyperparameters: {'priors': [0.8, 0.2], 'var_smoothing': 1e-05}

## Overall performance

The overall peformance of the model was:

- Test AUC: 0.6640069292947766
- precision: 0.7545304777594728
- recall: 0.29934640522875816
- fbeta: 0.4286382779597567

## Performance by slices

Note: the metrics are sorted in ascending order and follow the sequence of recall, precision, and fbeta respectively.

## Ethical Considerations
As far as we know, this data uses US dollars, which may not be suitable for certain use cases.
To obtain a more accurate understanding of people's purchasing power, it might be beneficial to use the local currency.

## Caveats and Recommendations
Observations reveal that there are two distinct groups in terms of performance on the "native-country" feature. One group has low performance, while the other has good performance (in the same "native-country" feature). This implies that geographical location may significantly impact the data. To address this issue, it is suggested to either create a model by country or to group similar countries and train a model accordingly. It is also recommended to test different algorithms to improve model performance.
